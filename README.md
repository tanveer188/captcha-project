# moCaptcha

## Introduction
Hello everyone. We are **Team One For All**, and today we introduce **moCaptcha**—a captcha system designed to be unsolvable by AI, ensuring only genuine human access.

## The AI Challenge
Traditional captchas are increasingly being cracked by online AI tools, from text-based and image challenges to behavioral noCaptcha methods. This vulnerability calls for a new approach to ensure security and human verification.

## Inspiration Behind moCaptcha
The idea for moCaptcha emerged while setting up a **Microsoft Azure Student** account, where I encountered a captcha with **10 steps**. The frustrating and inefficient process highlighted the need for a **simpler, more secure solution**.

## Our Core Principles
moCaptcha is built on three key principles:
- **Simplicity**: Easy for humans to solve.
- **Speed**: Quick resolution to reduce frustration.
- **AI-Resistance**: A robust, long-term barrier against automated attacks.

## Our Two-Layered Solution
1. **Microhash Puzzle Captcha**: A proof-of-work mechanism runs on the user's PC. If the computational work is completed, it confirms human interaction.
2. **Motion-Based Captcha**: Requires dynamic, human-only actions that are difficult for AI to mimic.

## Architecture & Demo
We’ll briefly explain how these two layers work together, followed by a **live demo** showcasing moCaptcha in action and its effectiveness against AI-driven attacks.
